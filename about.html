	<p> Hello! My name is Andrew, and I grew up in Southern Florida. During my childhood, most of my time was filled with days studying, and doing repetitive chores or tasks from school or my parents. My parents were often very strict, and this always left me feeling frightened and depressed. Since I was never a smart child, I was always given more educational work and took a very long time to learn subjects. This left me struggling; however, I pressed on. I had a tough childhood; I was often given more work during summer breaks which left me with few options to explore the world around me. This changed when I discovered technology. While this technology was an old laptop passed down by my parents, that hardly worked, it introduced me to a world that gave me excitement and new experiences that I had never really had before. From that moment forward I became fascinated by technology, information, and all the things you could do online, leading me to pursue a degree in information science. </p>

	<p> Throughout the Bachelor of Science in Information Science program or BSIS program, I explored various technology domains, including data analysis, health informatics, information security, intelligence analysis, and web development. While all these areas were interesting, I knew that I would not be able to specialize in such a diverse field. Therefore, I decided to primarily focus on the areas that interested me the most and were the most meaningful. Which were data analysis, since it had to do with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development. </p>


	<p> Early into the Bachelor of Science in Information Science or BSIS program, I learned database management using SQL. In these courses, I learned how to design and optimize relational databases. Moving forward I took cybersecurity courses along with my programming courses. This is where I learned the importance of risk assessment, network security, ethical hacking, common ways to secure information, and common problems with digital information. I took programming languages such as C++ and Java which taught me new programming languages and new algorithm skills. Helping me develop projects that I could eventually show my future employers within my application. The courses in data analysis and visualization were the most important since these skills gave me the ability to process, interpret, and present data efficiently and effectively. To do this I utilized Tableau, and the programming language R. In this course, I led a team to apply our skills to projects that demonstrated my abilities to collaborate, lead, and communicate with others.</p>


	<p> The specialized courses that I have taken, more specifically include Advanced Statistics & Analytics, Visual Analytics, Data & Text Mining, Predictive Analytics, Information Policy & Ethics, IT Concepts for Information Professionals, Discrete Math, Database Concepts, R Programming, C++ Programming, and Java Programming. These courses gave me an overall balanced technical educational experience and a strong mindset to learn more analytics. </p>


	<p> My work experience includes roles as an assistant at Palais Royale Offices and Marger Properties. This is where I utilized my technical skills to 
coordinate projects, optimize costs, calculate estimates, engineer a new sorting technique, develop structure, and analyze business data, to take the necessary actions to improve the business. Additionally, I participated in volunteer work at the beginning of my program. Helping a non-profit organization, more specifically, St. Vincent de Paul CARES. This gave me an insight into operations, services, and their needs. Especially so in how they must optimize their digital presence, develop strategies and techniques, and manage sensitive data, all on a strict budget. These experiences strengthened my real-world application abilities, demonstrating how I can practically apply these technical solutions in real-world settings. </p>


	<p> As I advance in my career, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to make a meaningful difference. Whether through data analysis, programming, artificial intelligence, software, or even cyber security. I am committed to making innovative solutions that drive progress and make a positive change. I invite you to explore my portfolio to see more of the work that I have done. Thank you. </p>
